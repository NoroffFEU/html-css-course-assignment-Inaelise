# HTML & CSS Course Assignment

![image](./assets/images/rainydays.webp)

## Description

This project was my contribution to the assignment for the HTML & CSS course. We had to create a functional, responsive website for an assignment brief we chose for the "Design 1" course. I had chosen "Rainy Days", you can find the brief here: https://github.com/NoroffFEU/first-year-cross-course-assignment-brief-one. In "Design 1" we had designed the website with Figma and now we were going to build it with html and css. We were not allowed to use JavaScript or any framework. We could "mimick" certain JS functionalities to make it more realistic.

## Requirements

These were the requirements for the assignment:

- We had to include every page that was listed in our chosen brief.
- We had to build semantic, neatly formatted and valid HTML.
- CSS needed to follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.
- The website needed to be responsive and look good on all screen sizes without horizontal scrollbars.
- The website needed to be WCAG compliant, and we needed to take accessibility into account.
- Each pages needed a unique meta description, title and h1.
- Use of copied code was not allowed. All submitted code had to be written by ourself.
